<h2>Firms and markets</h2>
<p><strong>You should understand…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>…how demand curves are derived from consumer willingness to pay</li>
<li>…the difference between fixed costs and variable costs</li>
<li>…how to calculate total cost, total revenue, average fixed costs, average variable costs, marginal cost, marginal revenue, and maximum profit</li>
<li>…that maximum profit occurs where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost (<span class="math inline">\(MR = MC\)</span>)</li>
<li>…that socially optimal quantity occurs when the demand is equal to the marginal cost (<span class="math inline">\(\text{demand} = MC\)</span>)</li>
<li>…how to calculate elasticity of demand (<span class="math inline">\(-\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \times \frac{P}{Q}\)</span>)</li>
<li>…what elasticity measures and why it is important in public policy and administration</li>
<li>…how a single demand curve can have an overall elasticity <em>and</em> different elasticities at each point</li>
<li>…economies of scale, diseconomies of scale, economies of agglomeration, network effects, and the difference between short-run and long-run costs</li>
<li>…that market equilibria (i.e. optimal price and quantity) occur at the intersection of supply and demand curves</li>
<li>…how government-imposed price floors and price ceilings distort market-clearing equilibria</li>
<li>…and be able to identify the differences between changes in supply/demand and changes in quantity supplied/demanded</li>
<li>…what consumer and producer surplus represent</li>
<li>…the relationship between elasticity of supply and/or demand and the size of consumer and producer surplus</li>
<li>…how taxes impose deadweight loss on society</li>
<li>…how the burden of taxes depends on the elasticity of supply and/or demand</li>
<li>…why governments tax and the philosophical and ethical principles behind who should bear the burden of taxes</li>
<li>…the difference between price-taking and price-making</li>
<li>…how firms try to gain market power, including monopolies, branding, cost controls, regulation, and switching costs</li>
<li>…why firms try to gain market power</li>
<li>…why firms want to price discriminate</li>
<li>…the consequences of monopolistic production (lower Q and higher P than what would happen under perfect competition; deadweight loss)</li>
<li>…how governments can regulate monopolies</li>
<li>…why natural monopolies exist and how governments can induce them to produce at socially optimal levels</li>
<li>…how firms need to be somewhat anti-competitive and anti-capitalist in order to maximize profits, innovate, and (essentially) be more competitive and capitalist</li>

<p><strong>Important formulas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Demand:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  P = aQ + b
  \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Total cost:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
  TC = TFC + TVC \\
  \text{or a formula using } Q \text{, like} \\
  TC = aQ^2 + b
  \end{aligned}
  \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Average cost:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  AC = \frac{TC}{Q}
  \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Marginal cost:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
  MC &amp;= \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q} \\
  &amp;\text{or} \\
  MC &amp;= \text{First derivative of TC} \\
  &amp;= 2aQ \text{ (if } TC = aQ^2 + b)
  \end{aligned}
  \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Total revenue:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
  TR &amp;= PQ \\
  &amp;\text{or} \\
  TR &amp;= (aQ + b)Q \\
  &amp;= aQ^2 + bQ
  \end{aligned}
  \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Average revenue:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  AR = \frac{TR}{Q}
  \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Marginal revenue:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
  MR &amp;= \frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q} \\
  &amp;\text{or} \\
  MR &amp;= \text{First derivative of TR} \\
  &amp;= 2aQ + b \text{ (if } TR = aQ^2 + bQ)
  \end{aligned}
  \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Maximum profit:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  max(\pi): MC = MR
  \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Price elasticity of demand (<a href="/resource/costs/#elasticity-of-demand/">see this guide</a> of how to get to <span class="math inline">\(- \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \times \frac{P}{Q}\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \varepsilon = -\frac{\% \text{ change in quantity demand}}{\% \text{ change in price}} = - \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \times \frac{P}{Q}
  \]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important graphs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consumer surplus, producer surplus, tax revenues, tax burdens, and deadweight loss (use algebra and geometry to figure out the areas of the triangles (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2} \times b \times h\)</span>) and rectangles (<span class="math inline">\(l \times w\)</span>)):</p>

<h2>Institutions, power, and inequality</h2>
<p><strong>You should understand…</strong></p>
